# Bio/Acc Content Generator

**Elite-Level Content Generation System with Advanced Quality Controls & Molecular Precision**

> From 100% success to **ELITE PERFORMANCE** with comprehensive quality analysis and zero content repetition.

## Overview

The Bio/Acc Content Generator is a sophisticated AI-powered system that creates high-quality, biologically-focused content for Twitter, Substack, and Gumroad. Built specifically for the Bio/Acc movement, it generates technically precise, sovereignty-focused content with perfect voice consistency and elite-level quality controls.

## Advanced Features

### ðŸ§  **Elite Quality Controls**
- **Mechanism Density Tracking**: 2.0 mechanisms per 100 words for threads, 1.5 for essays
- **Topic Alignment Validation**: Molecular-level specificity requirements with scoring
- **Content Deduplication Analysis**: Cross-day similarity detection prevents repetition
- **Hook Pattern Analysis**: Ensures unique hooks across all days
- **Voice Correction Engine**: Aggressive elimination of hedging and academic language

### ðŸŽ¯ **Molecular-Level Topic Requirements**
- **NK Cells**: CD56, CD16, NKp46, perforin, granzyme, KIR receptors, degranulation pathways
- **Innate Immunity**: TLR4-LPS, MyD88, TRIF, complement cascade, antimicrobial mechanisms
- **T-Cell Function**: Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg, transcription factors, metabolic requirements
- **Immune Dysregulation**: HLA associations, cytokine storms, epigenetic factors
- **Gut Immunity**: GALT, secretory IgA, microbiome crosstalk, SCFA effects
- **Adaptive Immunity**: Germinal centers, affinity maturation, immunological memory

### ðŸ”„ **Reliability & Performance**
- **API Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for rate limits and timeouts
- **Sequential Generation**: Context building with only previous day content
- **Triple-Version Saving**: Gemini drafts, Claude refinements, final versions
- **Comprehensive Quality Reporting**: Detailed analysis of all quality metrics
